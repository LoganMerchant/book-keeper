# Book Keeper

![](./misc/book-keeper.gif)

## Description

A MERN application that leverages the Google Books API to give users an easy place to keep track of books they're interested in buying and/or reading. Initially built with a RESTful API on the backend, this application has been rebuilt to take advantage of a GraphQL API instead!

## Installation

No installation is necessary, simply navigate to this [link](https://desolate-reaches-50430.herokuapp.com/) and sign up!

## Usage

While a user may take advantage of the search feature without creating an account, creating an account is highly encouraged since the main functionality will then become accessible.
<br>
Once signed up and logged in, a user can save any of the books that are returned by their search to their own `Saved Books` page. This page will keep track of any books the user has addedx and when a user decides they are no longer interested, they can delete it from the `Saved Books` page as easily as it was added.
